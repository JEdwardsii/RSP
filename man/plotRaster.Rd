\description{
If you are reading this it's because RSP failed to detect all of your receivers within the base raster provided, 
or any of your receiver location was found to be in land. This function allows you to visually identify the station(s) 
with problem. Please either extend your raster to include all stations or fix receiver locations to be in-water.
