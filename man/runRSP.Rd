\usage{
runRSP(
  input,
  base.raster,
  distance = 250,
  time.lapse = 10,
  er.ad = NULL,
  maximum.time = 24,
  debug = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{The output of one of actel's main functions (explore, migration or residency)}

\item{base.raster}{Raster file from the study area defining land (1) and water (0) regions.}

\item{distance}{Fixed distances in meters to add intermediate track locations. By default intermediate positions are added every 250 m.}

\item{time.lapse}{Temporal limit for the RSP in minutes. Consecutive detections shorter than the time.lapse will not have interpolated positions.}

\item{er.ad}{By default, 5\% of the distance argument is used as the increment rate of the position erros for the estimated locations. Alternatively, can be defined by the user in meters.}

\item{maximum.time}{Temporal lag in hours to be considered for the fine-scale tracking. Default is to consider 1-day intervals.}

\item{debug}{Logical: If TRUE, the function progress is saved to an RData file.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of RSP tracks (as dataframe) for each transmitter detected.
}
\description{
Estimates the RSP for a series of animals tracked with acoustic transmitters. Intermediate
locations are estimated according to fixed distance and temporal intervals.
