\title{Plot total distances travelled}
\usage{
plotDistances(input, group, compare = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{output of \code{\link{getDistances}}.}

\item{group}{Define a specific group to be plotted, rather than the overall results.}

\item{compare}{By default, a comparative plot is returned showing distances travelled with Receiver and RSP location
types. If FALSE, only the RSP total distances travelled will be returned.}
}
\value{
A barplot of total distances travelled as a function of location type (Loc.type) and the distances travelled during each RSP track.
}
\description{
Compare the outputs of total distances travelled (in kilometres) for the tracked animals, using only the 
receiver locations and adding the RSP positions. Data on the total distances travelled are stored in the 
'distances' object.
