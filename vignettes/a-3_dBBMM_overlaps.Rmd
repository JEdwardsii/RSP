## 3. Calculating utilization distribution areas and space-use overlaps

After estimating the in-water shortest paths, we can now use the output from `runRSP()` to calculate UD areas with the `dynBBMM()` function. Here you will need to know the [UTM zone](http://www.dmap.co.uk/utmworld.htm) of your study site and specify it using the argument `UTM.zone`. By default, the analysis will run for all transmitters detected, but you can determine also which transmitters you would like to include using `tags`. As mentioned before, UD areas can be calculated with either of the following temporal resolutions:

### 3.1. Total dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Model (group dBBMM)

This option calculates a series of dBBMM for each animal track from all the groups monitored. The `breaks` argument defines for which contours the areas of use should be calculated, which by default are the 50% and 95% (i.e. `breaks = c(.5, .95)`). 

Track **quality checks** are performed to ensure that only good tracks which allow the dBBMM to converge are included in the analysis. This is an example of the returned messages from `dynBBMM()`:

```
dbbmm.results <- dynBBMM(input = rsp.results, UTM.zone = 56, breaks = c(0.5, 0.95))

M: Preparing data to apply dBBMM.
M: No specific transmitters selected. All the data will be used for analysis.
Warning: 7 track(s) in group R64K-4075 have less than eight detections and will not be used.
Warning: 1 track(s) in group R64K-4075 are shorter than 30 minutes and will not be used.
Warning: 2 individual detections were removed in group R64K-4125 due to simultaneous detections at two receivers.
Warning: 2 track(s) in group R64K-4125 have less than eight detections and will not be used.
Warning: 1 track(s) in group R64K-4128 have less than eight detections and will not be used.
Warning: 2 track(s) in group R64K-4128 are shorter than 30 minutes and will not be used.
Warning: 6 track(s) in group R64K-4138 have less than eight detections and will not be used.
M: In total, 93 detections were excluded as they failed the track quality checks.
```

You can suppress the individual warning messages by setting `verbose` to FALSE. You will still receive the final message indicating how many detections were excluded.

After calculating UDs, the **land areas** are excluded so that the final results represent only **in-water areas of use**. The overall overlap between each group monitored is also calculated. 

```
M: Subtracting land areas from output.
M: Calculating overlaps between groups.
M: Storing final results.
```

The results of the dBBMM are saved in the `$track.areas` object, as a list of data frames for each group analysed:

|             Track|               Start|                Stop| Area.5| Area.95| Time.lapse.min|
|:-----------------|-------------------:|-------------------:|------:|-------:|--------------:|

| R64K-4125_Track_5| 2018-08-25 13:37:35| 2018-08-25 15:08:31|     53|     196|       90.93333|

Each `Track` is named after the transmitter and the corresponding track name and both `Start` and `Stop` timestamps are stored. The **areas of use** (by default `Area.5` = 50% and `Area.95` = 95%) are saved in squared metres, together with the respective elapsed times in minutes (Time.lapse.min). Note that in this example for the animal **R64K-4125** the tracks 1 and 7 failed the quality checks and thus were not included in the analysis. 

You can use `plotContours()` to visualize any of the dBBMM calculated by specifying the `group` and `track` you want to plot:

```
plotContours(input = dbbmm.results, group = "R64K-4138", track = "R64K-4138_Track_10")
plotContours(input = dbbmm.results, group = "R64K-4125", track = "R64K-4125_Track_3")
```
![The `levels` argument can be used to specify which contours to plot. By default, the **25%**, **50%**, **75%**, **95%** and **99%** contours are returned.](plotContours1.png){#id .class width=70% height=70%} 


### 3.2. Total space-use overlap 

Now that we calculated the areas of space-use within our study area for each group monitored, we can investigate the amount of overall overlap between them by inspecting the `$overlap.areas` object:

```
dbbmm.results$overlap.areas$`0.5`$absolute
```
|          | R64K-4075| R64K-4125| R64K-4128| R64K-4138|
|:---------|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|
| R64K-4075|        NA|      1716|      1792|      3606|
| R64K-4125|   	  1716|        NA|      1769|      3551|
| R64K-4128|	    1792|      1769|        NA|      2635|
| R64K-4138|      3606|      3551|      2635|        NA|

```
dbbmm.results$overlap.areas$`0.5`$percentage
```
|          | R64K-4075| R64K-4125| R64K-4128| R64K-4138|
|:---------|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|

| R64K-4138| 0.6049321| 0.7496306| 0.9962193|        NA|

```
dbbmm.results$overlap.areas$`0.95`$absolute
```
|          | R64K-4075| R64K-4125| R64K-4128| R64K-4138|
|:---------|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|
| R64K-4075|  	    NA|     12851|      4893|     17480|
| R64K-4125|     12851|        NA|      5115|     29210|
| R64K-4128|	  4893|      5115|        NA|      6839|
| R64K-4138|     17480|     29210|      6839|        NA|

```
dbbmm.results$overlap.areas$`0.95`$percentage
```
|          | R64K-4075| R64K-4125| R64K-4128| R64K-4138|
|:---------|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|
| R64K-4075|        NA| 0.7247349| 0.7133693| 0.9857884|
| R64K-4125| 0.7247349|        NA| 0.7457355| 0.9064672|
| R64K-4128| 0.7133693| 0.7457355|        NA| 0.9970841|
| R64K-4138| 0.9857884| 0.9064672| 0.9970841|        NA|

Please note the overlaps are calculated for the contours defined by `breaks` in `dynBBMM()`, and returned both in **absolute values** (squared metres) and **percentage** matrices. For example, we can see in the last table that **R64K-4128** and **R64K-4138** were the groups with higher overall overlap of 99.71% at the 95% level, whereas **R64K-4075** and **R64K-4128** had a smaller overlap of 71.34% at the 95% contour. To see exactly where space use overlaps occurred you can use `plotOverlap()`:

```
plotOverlap(input = dbbmm.results, stations = FALSE, level = .95, store = TRUE)
```

### 3.3. Fine-scale dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Model (timeslot dBBMM)

dBBMMs can also be calculated according to a moving temporal window. This allows investigating how the space-use overlap between the different groups varied during the study period. It is useful for assessing the influence of environmental parameters upon space-use of different groups tracked within the study area. The same `dynBBMM()` function is used, but here the argument `timeframe` has to be defined in hours as the temporal window. The total tracking period will be divided into `timeslots`, and dBBMMs calculated for each group monitored (for each timeslot). Overlapping areas are now calculated for each `timeslot` and the corresponding metadata stored in the `$timeslots` object:

```
time.dbbmm.results <- dynBBMM(input = rsp.results, UTM.zone = 56, breaks = c(0.5, 0.95), timeframe = 24) # 24-h timeslots
time.dbbmm.results$timeslots[400:410, ] 
```
| slot|               start|                stop| Bream| Luderick| Tarwhine|
|:----|-------------------:|-------------------:|-----:|--------:|--------:|
|  400| 2014-10-06 00:00:00| 2014-10-07 00:00:00| FALSE|    FALSE|    FALSE|
|  401| 2014-10-07 00:00:00| 2014-10-08 00:00:00| FALSE|    FALSE|    FALSE|
|  402| 2014-10-08 00:00:00| 2014-10-09 00:00:00| FALSE|    FALSE|    FALSE|
|  403| 2014-10-09 00:00:00| 2014-10-10 00:00:00| FALSE|    FALSE|    FALSE|
|  404| 2014-10-10 00:00:00| 2014-10-11 00:00:00|  TRUE|    FALSE|     TRUE|
|  405| 2014-10-11 00:00:00| 2014-10-12 00:00:00| FALSE|    FALSE|     TRUE|
|  406| 2014-10-12 00:00:00| 2014-10-13 00:00:00| FALSE|    FALSE|     TRUE|
|  407| 2014-10-13 00:00:00| 2014-10-14 00:00:00| FALSE|    FALSE|     TRUE|
|  408| 2014-10-14 00:00:00| 2014-10-15 00:00:00| FALSE|    FALSE|     TRUE|
|  409| 2014-10-15 00:00:00| 2014-10-16 00:00:00| FALSE|    FALSE|     TRUE|
|  410| 2014-10-16 00:00:00| 2014-10-17 00:00:00| FALSE|    FALSE|     TRUE|

In the example above (daily timeslots set using `timeframe = 24`) we can notice that in timeslots 400 to 403 none of the three groups monitored were detected, whereas both **Bream** and **Tarwhine** groups got detected in **slot 404** and from **slot 405** to **slot 410** only **Tarwhine** were detected. 

The `$track.areas` object for each tracked group will now have a first column named **Slot**, which identifies the `timeslot` for each of the dBBMM calculated:

```
time.dbbmm.results$track.areas$Bream[24:30, ]
```

|Slot|                Track|              Start|               Stop|Area.5|Area.95|Time.lapse.min|
|:---|--------------------:|------------------:|------------------:|-----:|------:|-------------:|
| 404|A69-9004-485_Track_01|2014-10-10 10:08:08|2014-10-10 10:38:15|   289|   1245|      30.11667|
| 411|A69-9004-485_Track_02|2014-10-17 12:41:35|2014-10-17 23:59:03|   635|   3489|     677.46667|

| 413|A69-9004-485_Track_02|2014-10-19 00:18:55|2014-10-19 06:45:37|   231|   1062|     386.70000|
| 425|A69-9004-485_Track_04|2014-10-31 10:24:47|2014-10-31 23:51:01|   685|   2731|     806.23333|
| 426|A69-9004-485_Track_04|2014-11-01 00:00:59|2014-11-01 23:58:59|  1158|   5344|    1438.00000|
| 427|A69-9004-485_Track_04|2014-11-02 00:08:18|2014-11-02 23:53:08|   624|   2515|    1424.83333|

Here we can see that the Bream **A69-9004-485** was detected consecutively between `2014-10-17 12:41:35` and `2014-10-19 06:45:37` (Track_02) and again between `2014-10-31 10:24:47` and `2014-11-02 23:53:08` (Track_04). 

The following command line can help you assess if any other group got detected during a particular `timeslot`:

```
> time.dbbmm.results$timeslots[404, ]
    slot               start                stop Bream Luderick Tarwhine
404  404 2014-10-10 00:00:00 2014-10-11 00:00:00  TRUE    FALSE     TRUE
```

Yes, both **Bream** and **Tarwhine** were detected between `2014-10-10 00:00:00` and `2014-10-11 00:00:00` (**timeslot 404**). We can now inspect whether the two groups overlapped or not:

```
> time.dbbmm.results$overlap.areas$`0.95`$percentage$`404`
             Bream Luderick  Tarwhine
Bream           NA       NA 0.9799197
Luderick        NA       NA        NA
Tarwhine 0.9799197       NA        NA
```

This shows that the two groups had an overlap of 97.99% at the 95% dBBMM contour during this particular `timeslot` (or in this case, day). We can now see exactly where the overlap occurred by plotting the space use models and the overlap contours using:

```
plotContours(input = time.dbbmm.results, group = "Bream", track = "A69-9004-485_Track_01", main = "A69-9004-485 (Bream)", stations = TRUE, timeslot = 404)
plotContours(input = time.dbbmm.results, group = "Tarwhine", track = "A69-9004-489_Track_1", main = "A69-9004-489 (Tarwhine)", stations = TRUE, timeslot = 404)
```
![Setting the argument `stations = TRUE` will include the locations of acoustic receivers in the plot.](plotContours2.png){#id .class width=120% height=120%}

Here we can see how these two transmitters really occurred in a similar region during `timeslot = 404`. To inspect for the total space use areas at group level, and the exact overlap in space and time we can use `plotOverlap()`:

```
> plotOverlap(input = dbbmm_time_24, level = .95, store = TRUE, stations = FALSE, timeslot = 404, main = "2014-10-10")
M: No overlap found between 'Bream' and 'Luderick'.
M: No overlap found between 'Luderick' and 'Tarwhine'.
```
