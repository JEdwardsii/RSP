After estimating the in-water shortest paths, we can now use the output from `runRSP()` to calculate utilization distribution areas using **dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models** with the `dynBBMM()` function. If you are using a geographic coordinate reference system, here you will need to know the [UTM zone](http://www.dmap.co.uk/utmworld.htm) of your study site and specify it using the argument `UTM`. By default, the analysis will run for all transmitters detected, but you can determine also which transmitters you would like to include using `tags`. 

### 3.1. Total dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Model (group dBBMM)

This option calculates a series of dBBMM for each animal track from all the groups monitored and included in the `runRSP()` analysis. Track **quality checks** are performed to ensure that only good tracks which allow the dBBMM to converge are included in the analysis. This is an example of the returned messages from `dynBBMM()`:

```
dbbmm.results <- dynBBMM(input = rsp.results, UTM = 32)

M: Preparing data to apply dBBMM.
M: No specific transmitters selected. All the data will be used for analysis.
Warning: 7 track(s) in group R64K-4075 have less than eight detections and will not be used.
Warning: 1 track(s) in group R64K-4075 are shorter than 30 minutes and will not be used.
Warning: 2 individual detections were removed in group R64K-4125 due to simultaneous detections at two receivers.
Warning: 2 track(s) in group R64K-4125 have less than eight detections and will not be used.
Warning: 1 track(s) in group R64K-4128 have less than eight detections and will not be used.
Warning: 2 track(s) in group R64K-4128 are shorter than 30 minutes and will not be used.
Warning: 6 track(s) in group R64K-4138 have less than eight detections and will not be used.
M: In total, 93 detections were excluded as they failed the track quality checks.
```
<!-- PAREI AQUI!! -->
You can suppress the individual warning messages by setting `verbose` to FALSE. You will still receive the final message indicating how many detections were excluded.

After calculating UDs, the **land areas** are excluded so that the final results represent only **in-water areas of use**. The overall overlap between each group monitored is also calculated. 

```
M: Subtracting land areas from output.
M: Storing final results.
M: Percentage of detections valid for RSP: 99.8%
```

The metadata on the dBBMMs are saved in the `$valid.tracks` object as data frame:

| Group|       Tag|   Track|valid.n|         First.time|          Last.time|   Timespan|
|:-----|---------:|-------:|------:|------------------:|------------------:|----------:|
|     A| R64K-4075|Track_03|    125|2018-03-07 00:41:10|2018-03-07 08:20:02| 7.64 hours|
|     A| R64K-4075|Track_08|     27|2018-04-23 05:10:47|2018-04-23 08:43:45| 3.54 hours|
|     A| R64K-4075|Track_09|    303|2018-04-24 11:40:56|2018-04-26 01:00:13|37.32 hours|
|     B| R64K-4125|Track_02|    206|2018-04-21 13:13:24|2018-04-23 09:09:34|43.93 hours|
|     B| R64K-4125|Track_03|   1118|2018-04-25 11:44:05|2018-04-28 14:10:14|74.43 hours|

Included is information on the biological group (Group) tracked, number of valid locations (valid.n) used, and the duration of each model (Timespan) in hours.

You can use `plotContours()` to visualize any of the dBBMM calculated by specifying the `group` and `track` you want to plot:

```
plotContours(input = dbbmm_all, tag = "R64K-4138", track = "10")
plotContours(input = dbbmm_all, tag = "R64K-4125", track = "3")
```
![The `breaks` argument can be used to specify which contours to plot. By default, the **25%**, **50%**, **75%**, and **95%** contours are returned. Again `addStations()` can be used to add the receiver locations.](plotContours1.png){#id .class width=70% height=70%} 


### 3.2. Fine-scale dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Model (timeslot dBBMM)

dBBMMs can also be calculated according to a moving temporal window. This allows investigating how the space-use overlap between the different groups varied during the study period. It is useful for assessing the influence of environmental parameters upon space-use of different groups tracked within the study area. The same `dynBBMM()` function is used, but here the argument `timeframe` has to be defined in hours as the temporal window. The total tracking period will be divided into `timeslots`, and dBBMMs calculated for each group monitored (for each timeslot). Overlapping areas are now calculated for each `timeslot` and the corresponding metadata stored in the `$timeslots` object:

```
time.dbbmm.results <- dynBBMM(input = rsp.results, UTM.zone = 56, breaks = c(0.5, 0.95), timeframe = 24) # Daily (24-h) timeslots!
time.dbbmm.results$timeslots
```
| slot|               start|                stop| Bream| Luderick| Tarwhine|

|  406| 2014-10-12 00:00:00| 2014-10-13 00:00:00| FALSE|    FALSE|     TRUE|
|  407| 2014-10-13 00:00:00| 2014-10-14 00:00:00| FALSE|    FALSE|     TRUE|

|  410| 2014-10-16 00:00:00| 2014-10-17 00:00:00| FALSE|    FALSE|     TRUE|

In the example above (daily timeslots set using `timeframe = 24`) we can notice that in timeslots 400 to 403 none of the three groups monitored were detected, whereas both **Bream** and **Tarwhine** groups got detected in **slot 404** and from **slot 405** to **slot 410** only **Tarwhine** were detected. 

The `$track.areas` object for each tracked group will now have a first column named **Slot**, which identifies the `timeslot` for each of the dBBMM calculated:

```
time.dbbmm.results$track.areas$Bream[24:30, ]
```

|Slot|                Track|              Start|               Stop|Area.5|Area.95|Time.lapse.min|

Here we can see that the Bream **A69-9004-485** was detected consecutively between `2014-10-17 12:41:35` and `2014-10-19 06:45:37` (Track_02) and again between `2014-10-31 10:24:47` and `2014-11-02 23:53:08` (Track_04). 

The following command line can help you assess if any other group got detected during a particular `timeslot`:

```
> time.dbbmm.results$timeslots[404, ]
    slot               start                stop Bream Luderick Tarwhine
404  404 2014-10-10 00:00:00 2014-10-11 00:00:00  TRUE    FALSE     TRUE
```

Yes, both **Bream** and **Tarwhine** were detected between `2014-10-10 00:00:00` and `2014-10-11 00:00:00` (**timeslot 404**). We can now inspect whether the two groups overlapped or not:

```
> time.dbbmm.results$overlap.areas$`0.95`$percentage$`404`
             Bream Luderick  Tarwhine
Bream           NA       NA 0.9799197
Luderick        NA       NA        NA
Tarwhine 0.9799197       NA        NA
```

This shows that the two groups had an overlap of 97.99% at the 95% dBBMM contour during this particular `timeslot` (or in this case, day). We can now see exactly where the overlap occurred by plotting the space use models and the overlap contours using:

```
plotContours(input = time.dbbmm.results, group = "Bream", track = "A69-9004-485_Track_01", main = "A69-9004-485 (Bream)", stations = TRUE, timeslot = 404)
plotContours(input = time.dbbmm.results, group = "Tarwhine", track = "A69-9004-489_Track_1", main = "A69-9004-489 (Tarwhine)", stations = TRUE, timeslot = 404)
```
![Setting the argument `stations = TRUE` will include the locations of acoustic receivers in the plot.](plotContours2.png){#id .class width=120% height=120%}

Here we can see how these two transmitters really occurred in a similar region during `timeslot = 404`. To inspect for the total space use areas at group level, and the exact overlap in space and time we can use `plotOverlap()`:

```
> plotOverlap(input = dbbmm_time_24, level = .95, store = TRUE, stations = FALSE, timeslot = 404, main = "2014-10-10")
M: No overlap found between 'Bream' and 'Luderick'.
M: No overlap found between 'Luderick' and 'Tarwhine'.
```
